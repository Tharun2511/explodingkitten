Exploding Kitten Cards 💣: The dreaded bomb that spells instant defeat for the player unlucky enough to draw it. With each exploding kitten drawn, the tension mounts as players race against the deck.

Defuse Cards 🙅‍♂️: A player's lifeline against exploding kittens, defuse cards can be used strategically to neutralize a bomb, allowing the player to continue their quest without fear of explosion.

Shuffle Cards 🔀: A wildcard that throws a twist into the game, shuffle cards reset the deck, reshuffling the cards and providing players with a fresh chance at success.
